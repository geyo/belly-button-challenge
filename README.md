**Programming Languages:** Javascript, D3, Plotly.js

## Purpose

Create an interactive dashboard exploring [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), using D3 to read json data. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Steps

1. Use D3 library to retrieve data stored in JSON format. 
2. In Javascript, create functions that generate the following visualizations when an ID is selected:
    - Top Ten OTUs Bar Chart, 
    - Top Ten OTUs Bubble Bar Chart, 
    - Demographic Metadata Explorer, 
    - washing frequency gauge. 
3. Create corresponding html.
